## Description
This was implemented this using REACT JS and styled with pure CSS.<br>It is just a basic Article Blog WebApp that has the function of creating & deleting an article blog.<br>This in fact is my very first REACT project and it has helped me to understand the basics of REACT.<br>I'm also running a JSON server that was hardcoded during the project to manage the blog articles data.

### Setup:

- install node modules

```sh
npm install
```
- run JSON server

```sh
npx json-server --watch data/db.json --port 8000
```

- run dev server

```sh
npm start
```

-The project loads up in your browserðŸŒŸ
